            <h2>Bio:</h2>
            <p> Born in Seattle, Washington, Hendrix began playing guitar at the age of 15. In 1961,
                he enlisted in the U.S. Army and trained as a paratrooper in the 101st Airborne Division;
                he was granted an honorable discharge the following year. Soon afterward, he moved to Clarksville,
                Tennessee, and began playing gigs on the Chitlin' Circuit, earning a place in the Isley Brothers'
                backing band and later with Little Richard, with whom he continued to work through mid-1965.
                He then played with Curtis Knight and the Squires before moving to England in late 1966 after being
                discovered by Linda Keith, who in turn interested bassist Chas Chandler of the Animals in becoming
                his first manager. Within months, Hendrix had earned three UK top ten hits with the Jimi Hendrix
                Experience: "Hey Joe", "Purple Haze", and "The Wind Cries Mary". He achieved fame in the U.S. after
                his performance at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967, and in 1968 his third and final studio album,
                Electric Ladyland, reached number one in the U.S.; it was Hendrix's most commercially successful
                release and his first and only number one album. The world's highest-paid performer,
                he headlined the Woodstock Festival in 1969 and the Isle of Wight Festival in 1970,
                before his accidental death from barbiturate-related asphyxia on September 18, 1970,
                at the age of 27</p>
